# Lemty (a project inspired by [Klenty](https://www.klenty.com/))

__ It is a bulk emailing software which I created to help me in my business and to test my skills as a developer. Since I am a software developer not a UI Designer, its UI looks exactly Klenty but the code from back to front is purely mine. __
