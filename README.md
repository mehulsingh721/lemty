# Lemty (a project inspired by [Klenty](https://www.klenty.com/))

It is a bulk emailing software which I created to help me in my business and to test my skills as a developer. Since I am a software developer not a UI Designer, its UI looks exactly Klenty but the code from back to front is purely mine.

## Project Description
#### Features
Just like most bulk emailing softwares lemty's goal is to improve email deliveribility and convert prospects into clients. I have put a lot of hard work into this to include features like:

* Open Tracking
* Link Click Tracking
* Upload prospects from CSV.
* Add multiple Emails.
* Follow up emails.
* Campaign Reporting.
* Custom Email Intervals
* Preview and edit prospects before starting campaign.
* Set custom hours for sending emails.

#### Tech Stack
To accommodate the this many features and still build as solid application I chose:
* Spring Boot (Java framework for building REST APIs)
* ReactJS (Frontend)
* Postgresql (Database)
* Quartz (Job Scheduling)
* Gmail API
* Heroku (Backend Server)
* Netlify (Frontend Server)
